Earthquake Watcher Service
==========================

This project holds a file @ src/EqSimple.java that reads
a file simulating recent earthquakes and another file that simulates
people that would like to be alerted of nearby earthquakes.

The output that is generated is information about the earthquakes
and which watchers are closeby to new earthquakes.
